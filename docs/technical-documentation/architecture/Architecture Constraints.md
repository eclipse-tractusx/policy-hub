# Architecture Constraints

## General

- This project provides an readonly API, there is no plan to implement an UI at the current stage.

- Run anywhere: can be deployed as a docker image, e. g. on Kubernetes (platform-independent, cloud, on prem or local).

## Developer

- OpenSource software first - FOSS licenses approved by the eclipse foundation has to be used. It could represent the initial set that the CX community agrees on to regulate the content contribution under FOSS licenses.

- Coding guidelines for BE are defined and are to be followed for all policy hub related developments.

- Apache License 2.0 - Apache License 2.0 is one of the approved licenses which should be used to respect and guarantee Intellectual property (IP).

- Code Analysis, Linting and Code Coverage - Consistent style increases readability and maintainability of the code base. Hence, we use analyzers to enforce consistency and style rules. We enforce the code style and rules in the CI to avoid merging code that does not comply with standards.

## Code analysis, linting and code coverage

As part of the standard reviews, following code analysis and security checks have been executed:

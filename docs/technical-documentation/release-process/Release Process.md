# Release Process

The release process for a new version can roughly be divided into the following steps:

- [Preparations on the release branch](#preparations-on-the-release-branch)
- [Update CHANGELOG.md](#update-changelogmd)
- [Merge release branch](#merge-release-branch)
- [RC: provide successive rc branch and change base of open PRs](#rc-provide-successive-rc-branch-and-change-base-of-open-prs)

The process builds on the [Development Flow](../dev-process/Dev-flow_git-diagram.md) which, usually, takes place within forks and leads to merged pull requests in the repositories of the eclipse-tractusx organization.

For assigning and incrementing **version** numbers [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) is followed.

## Preparations on the release branch

Checking out from the main branch a release branch (release/{to be released version} e.g. release/v1.2.0, or respectively release/v1.2.0-rc.1 for a release candidate).
On the release branch the following steps are executed:

### 1. Aggregate migrations

Migrations should be **aggregated in the case of releasing a new version**, in order to not release the entire history of migrations which accumulate during the development process.

Once a version has been released, migrations **mustn't be aggregated** in order to ensure upgradeability this also applies to **release candidates > rc.1 and hotfixes**.
Be aware that migrations coming release branches for release candidates or from hotfix branches, will **need to be incorporated into main**.

### 2. Version bump

The version needs to be updated in the `src` directory within the 'Directory.Build.props' file.

Also, bump the chart and app version in the [Chart.yaml](../../../charts/policy-hub/Chart.yaml) and the version of the images in the [values.yaml](../../../charts/policy-hub/values.yaml).

_Consortia relevant:  Update the version of the targetRevision tag in the [argocd-app-templates](../../../consortia/argocd-app-templates/), used for consortia-environments._

Example for commit message:

_build: bump version for vx.x.x_

### 3. Update README (on chart level)

Use [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) (gotemplate driven) for updating the README file.

```bash
helm-docs --chart-search-root [charts-dir] --sort-values-order file
```

Example for commit message:

_build: update readme for vx.x.x_

## Update CHANGELOG.md

The changelog file tracks all notable changes since the last released version.
Once a new version is ready to be released, the changelog can get updated via an automatically created pull request using the [release-please workflow](../../../.github/workflows/release-please.yml) which can be triggered manually or by pushing a _changelog/v*.*.*_ branch.

Please see:

- [How release please works](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action/tree/v4.0.2?tab=readme-ov-file#how-release-please-works)
- [How do I change the version number?](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/v16.7.0?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-change-the-version-number)
- [How can I fix release notes?](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/v16.7.0?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-fix-release-notes)

## Merge release branch

The release branch must be merged into main.
The merge needs to happen via PRs.

Example for PR titles:

_build(1.2.0): merge release into main_

> Be aware that the merge into main triggers the workflow with the [helm-chart releaser action](../../../.github/workflows/chart-release.yaml).
>
> The workflow creates a 'policy-hub-x.x.x' tag and release. The release contains the new chart.
>
> This workflow also pushes the version tag that triggers the [release workflow](../../../.github/workflows/release.yml) which creates the versioned docker image/s.


_Consortia relevant: The 'policy-hub-x.x.x' tag is used to install (with the convenience of the argocd-app-templates) or upgrade the version via AgroCD on the consortia K8s clusters._

## RC: provide successive rc branch and change base of open PRs

During a release candidate phase, checkout the successive 'rc' branch and push it to the server, so that it can be used for further bugfixes.

Example:

```bash
git checkout tags/v0.1.0-rc.2 -b release/v0.1.0-rc.3
```

Also make sure to change the base of all open pull requests still pointing to the previous 'rc' branch to the newly pushed 'rc' branch.
